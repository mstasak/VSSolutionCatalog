Purpose of project is to create and maintain a catalog of Visual Studio 
solutions found at or under one or more user-specified directories.

User can make notes, rate projects, and disposition them (completion
status and keep/delete).  Identifying notable reusable code would be a
plus.  Hoping to shrink my bloated \Dev and \Proj directory trees.
