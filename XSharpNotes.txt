VS Extension Help does not list PARTIAL among valid CLASS modifiers,
in CLASS Statement (All dialects)

Class member variables are called, somewhat confusingly, fields.  It was difficult to find the
documentation entries for EXPORT, PROTECTED, and others, if any (shouldn't there be matches for 
public, private, protected, and internal?)
