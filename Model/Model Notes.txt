Model Notes

Trying to use Entity Framework (for .Net Framework 4.8? or can I use Core?  I think 4.8),
with a PostgreSQL database at localhost:5432.

User setup:

//schema owner
create user 'VSSOLCAT' identified by 'password';
grant x to VSSOLCAT;

//administrator
create user 'VSSOLCATADMIN' identified by 'password';
grant x to VSSOLCAT;

//app user
create user 'VSSOLCATUSER' identified by 'password';
grant x to VSSOLCAT;

//query (read only) user
create user 'VSSOLCATQUERY' identified by 'password';
grant x to VSSOLCAT;


Schema will be designed in code classed, managed by EF.
